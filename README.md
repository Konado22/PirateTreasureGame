# PirateTreasureGame

A python machine learning script utilizing keras to help teach program how to win the game. Utlizing Keras as well as Deep Q-learning we are able to help teach the program the proper pathing required to reach the treasure before the player. Using pyplot we can create a visual representation of the game map and possible moves. The machine also is given parameteres to determine win conditions and rewards based upon moves. From a completly random start the program will begin to learn and make moves based upon experience or expoitation. Machine learining is very prevelant in society and it is important to recognize what algorithims and types of machine learning that are used, as there are different approaches that exist. In a game application there isn't as much ethical concern as there is with AI in society but it is important to understand the usage of a program and review results achieved as a computer scientist and always aim for no bias in an application

## Installation
We are provided starter code for the treasurehunt game as well as the methodology regarding the program and its behavior. We are then able to construct the algorithim for the games as well as logging the proggress of the machine and reflecting results in a visual representation through pyplot
Required modules include:
* Keras
* sys
* time
* matplotlib
* random
* json

## Usage

We are able to construct a maze and visually represent it through matplot
